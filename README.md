# Zeig.li â€” Hyperlocal Search and Discovery for Physical Environments
A simple, room-scale search and discovery mechanism, based on time series of visually detected QR-codes, and maybe lasers.

> Work in progress. Interested? Contact thomas.amberg@fhnw.ch
## Getting started
* Try it at https://zeig.li/
* Buy <a href="#what-you-need">what you need</a>.
* See <a href="#how-it-works">how it works</a>.
## What you need
* Web browser - for "browsing the room".
* Wi-Fi cam - any Web cam should work.
* QR-codes - printed on sticky paper.
## How it works
* Items get QR-codes - each item gets annotated with a URI, to be trackable.
* The cam watches - it sees the room getting filled with items, and keeps notes.
* And remembers - ask it what's in the room, when an item was added, where it is.
## More to come
* A future version might involve lasers, to point you to the item you're looking for.
