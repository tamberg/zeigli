# Hyperlocal Search and Discovery for Physical Environments
A simple, room-scale search and discovery mechanism, based on time series of (pictures tagged with) visually detected QR-Codes.
## Getting started
* Try it live at ...
* Buy <a href="#what-you-need">what you need</a>.
* See <a href="#how-it-works">how it works</a>.
## What you need
* Web browser - For "browsing the room".
* Wi-Fi Cam - Any Web cam should work.
* QR-Codes - Printed on sticky paper.
## How it works
* Items get QR-Codes - each item gets a QR-Code with a GUID, to be trackable.
* The cam watches - it sees the room getting filled with items, and keeps notes.
* And remembers - ask it what's in the room, when an item was added, where it is.
